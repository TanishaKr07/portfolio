    <h1>Tanisha</h1>
    <p>Hi there! My name is Tanisha and I am a senior at UC San Diego
        majoring in Cognitive & Behavioral Neuroscience with a minor in 
        Data Science.</p>
    <p>
        I am excited by the potential of data-driven approaches to unravel 
        the complexities of the brain, and applying these insights to 
        improving mental health outcomes. </p>
    <p>
        I am currently building a mood and wellness tracking web app - "Moodicle" 
        to help individuals monitor and manage their mental health. It uses NLP
        techniques to analyze journal entries and provide insights into mood patterns.
        It also has a built-in mental health support chatbot that offers coping 
        strategies and resources based on user input. It also includes a wellness
        activity tracker to encourage positive habits and routines.
        Outside of academics, I enjoy creative writing, listening to music, and
        (very specifically) learning about the etymology of names!
